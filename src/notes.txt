1.1: 
This interface defines what the context value will look like when used with React’s Context API for managing users.

1.2: 
user: User[] | null
This represents the state of users in the app.
User[] → An array of user objects (each conforming to the User interface).
| null → It could also be null (maybe initially, or if no user data is loaded yet).

1.3: 
addUser: (user: User) => void
This is a function that accepts/add a single user object (of type User) and adds it to the list.
=> void → Means the function does not return anything.

1.4: 
updateUser: (id: string) => void
A function that takes an id (assuming you're associating users with unique string identifiers).
Purpose: It will update a user’s details based on their ID.
=> void: No return value expected.

// Note: Right now this function only takes an ID. In real-world apps, it often also accepts new user data to apply during update, like updateUser: (id: string, updatedData: Partial<User>) => void.

1.5: 
deleteUser: (id: string) => void
A function to remove a user from the user list.
Takes an id (string), and removes the user with that id.
